Spring List Binder
==================

This is simply an example of how to bind a list of objects in Spring. 

The ViewModel `Order` contains a list of items. The form is constructed using spring's form taglib.

The name of the item is included in the form-backing object, not a good idea. But it's ok for a demo I guess.
